Github
https://github.com/JTMabutas17/Naruto_Portfolio (for deployed repository)
https://github.com/JTMabutas17/CECS448/tree/main/project2 (where we made commits/changes)
We originally wanted all our Projects in one repository, but for React to deploy a website, it needs to be at the root. This is why we had to make a new repository for the website.
